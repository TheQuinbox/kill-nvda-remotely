Kill NVDA Remotely.
This is a simple set of Windows programs that lets you restart NVDA on a remote machine (typically because you've lost your NVDA Remote connection).

Usage:
1. Download the latest release.
2. Unzip it to a folder of your choice.
3. Open config.ini in your favorite text editor, and edit it with your prefered IP address and port. It's worth noting that the IP address is of the remote machine.
4. Open the port on your router (if you want to be able to do this from somewhere that's not where ever your computer is).
5. Run server.exe on the remote machine.
6. Whenever you need to restart your NVDA on that machine, run client.exe.

To exit the server, simply click on its system tray icon.
